# Grades Histogram

A java project that creates a histogram based on a file with grades.





### Running the project

In order to run the project in the command line go to repository's root directory (your local directory where you cloned the project) and type

```
java -jar seip2020_practical_assignments/gradeshistogram/target/gradeshistogram-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar <grades file path>
```

A new window showing a graph should open. The x axis represents the grades and the y axis represents the frequency of each grade.
